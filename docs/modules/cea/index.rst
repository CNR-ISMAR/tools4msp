Cumulative Effects Assessment
=============================

Aim of the module
-----------------
In the last decade cumulative effects assessment (CEA) analysis has become an essential tool for the geospatial
identification of highly impacted environmental components by marine anthropogenic uses. Since the application
of Halpern’s CEA analysis on global scale in 2008 (Halpern et al., 2008), several studies around the world have
been investigating CEA patterns on sea basin level, such as in the Mediterranean Sea (Micheli et al., 2013),
Baltic Sea (Korpinen et al., 2012) or North Sea (Andersen et al., 2013).

The Tools4MSP CEA, based on methodology develped by Halper et al. (2008) and later modified by Andersen et al.
(2013), provides maritime spatial planners with an instrument for the setup and monitoring of conservation
strategies supporting the ecosystem-based approach, that can localize type of pressures and most impacting
maritime uses also in transboundary domain, and therefore define sea use specific management strategies for
target ecosystem components (Menegon et al. 2018).

Conceptual model
----------------

The Tools4MSP CEA approach incorporates a key aspect of the environmental risk assessment discipline which is the
explicit identification and understanding of the source-pressure-pathway-receptor linkages (Judd et al., 2015;
Stelzenmüller et al., 2018). More in detail, the linkages are modeled through two independent but concatenate tasks:

1. pressures assessment: from human uses to pressures
2. effects/impacts assessment: from pressures to impacts

Task 1: pressure assessment
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
The pressure assessment estimates the propagation of pressures generated by one or multiple
anthropogenic uses.

Considering a single grid cell of analysis, the value of the pressure j is given as:

.. math::
    P_{j}(x) = \sum_{i=1}^{l} w_{i, j} \; p_{i,j}(x)
   :label: eq:pj

where:

* :math:`P_j` = j-th pressure
* x = single grid cell of analysis
* l = number of human uses
* :math:`w_{i,j}` = use-specific relative pressure weight: a measure of the relative importance of different
  uses contributing to a certain pressure

In the above equation :math:`p_{i,j}(x)` represents the contribution of the i-th human use to the j-th pressure.
By default, in order to simulate the pressure dispersion from the source (human use), the tools4MSP CEA module
implements a flexible distance model based on a 2D convolution with a gaussian kernel function.
Hence, :math:`p_{i,j}` is given as:

.. math::
    p_{i,j}(x) = \sum_{x'\in X} U_i(x') \; G(d(x',x), b_{i,j}/2)
   :label: eq:pij

where:

* :math:`X` = the set of all grid cells
* :math:`U_i(x')` =  intensity or presence/absence of th i-th human use over the cell x'
* G = gaussian function
* d(x',x) = euclidean distance between cell x and cell x'
* :math:`b_{i,j}` = buffer distance varying from 0 (local pressure) to 50 km

The pressure assessment based on the convolution distance model can be applied to any human use independently from its
spatial structure (point, polygon or line feature).
According to the Equations :eq:`eq:pj` :eq:`eq:pij` "buffer distance" and "pressure weight" are the required input
parameters for each use-pressure combination.
Such parameters are usually expert-based and they are derived from stakeholder engagement. In addition, they may
vary from area to area. Figures :numref:`cea-weights-matrix` and :numref:`cea-distances-matrix` show
the pressure weight and the buffer distance values for each use-pressure combination in  the
Adriatic sea.

Figure :numref:`cea-example-spatial-convolution` illustrates an example of the distance model convolution (:eq:`eq:pij`).
THe model has been applied for estimating the spatial distribution of the pressure "Introduction of non-synthetic
substances and compounds" (NONSYNTH) exerted by the source "Maritime transport" (SHIPDENS).

   for the Adriatic Sea.

Advanced pressure assessment
############################

Alternatively to the default pressure assessment, in case of non-isotropic propagation of
pressures generated by complex hydrodynamic phenomena (e.g. river plume induced currents, transitional waters),
the model allows to directly integrate pressure indicators from measured datasets or generated by external
models, such as hydrodynamic model applications (see modelling of land-based activities on Menegon et al., 2017
and Depellegrin et al., 2017).




Task 2: effects/impacts assessments
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
The effects/impacts assessment task allows to spatially assess the spatial distribution of impact exerted by one or multiple
pressures on one or multiple environmental receptors. The impact assessment is based on sensitivity/vulnerability
scores which represents the "likelihood of change when a pressure is applied to a feature (receptor)
and is a function of the ability of the feature to tolerate or resist change (resistance) and its ability to
recover from impact (resilience) (Tillin et al., 2010). Similarly to buffer weights and pressure distances,
the sensitivities scores are usually expert-based and they are derived from stakeholder engagement. In Figure
:numref:`cea-distances-matrix` an example of sensitivity matrix for combinations of different pressures and
environmental components is presented.



CEA module workflow: identification of pressures/effects (P/Eff) on the environmental component (E) and
identification and quantification of single or multiple human uses (U) generating the pressure/effects.

The method is based on a consolidated methodology developed within the Tools4MSP modelling framework. Results of the
CEA will highlight sea areas of highest cumulative on a single and multisector level Cumulative Effects based on the
Tools4MSP Modelling Framework.

CEA supporting MSP
------------------

Cumulative Effects Assessment is the privileged tool to incorporate ecosystem based approach into the MSP process.

According to Pinarbasi et al. (2017), the MSP process can be subdivided into seven steps
(see :numref:`cea-msp-steps`). CEA module has been designed to directly support three steps:
Gather data and define current condition, Identify issues, constraints, and future condition and
Evaluate alternative management actions.

Additional examples of use of CEA module in supporting the MSP process are:

* investigate the area of influence of the pressure: distinguish among local, short and long range cumulative effects.
* identify and localize transboundary dimension of cumulative effects
* performing scenario analysis to test planning options
