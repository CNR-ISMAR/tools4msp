Tools4MSP
=========

Tools4MSP is a python-based Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) for
geospatial analysis in support of Maritime Spatial Planning (MSP) and
marine environmental management. Tools4MSP implements models for
Cumulative Effects Assessment (CEA), Maritime Use Conflict (MUC)
Analysis and Marine Ecosystem Services Threat (MES-Threat) analysis.
The package can be used as stand-alone library or as integrated
GeoNode Plugin providing additional functionalities to geospatial CMS
and enhancing usability through a graphical user interface (GUI).


Description
===========

The webtools (GeoNode integration) analysis workflow follows a four step approach:

* Step 0: Webtool selection: The user can select among CEA, MUC and
  MES-Threat webtools
* Step 1: Case study selection: The user can select the area of
  interest for the webtools application.
* Step 2: Dataset configuration: The user can select the environmental
  components, human activities and MSFD pressure for the model run.
* Step 3: Results & Outputs: The user can view, explore, share,
  document and download geospatial and statistical results of the
  model run.

Tools4MSP is currenlty implemented into the Tools4MPS Geoplatform (http://data.tools4msp.eu)
